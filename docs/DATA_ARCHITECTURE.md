# Local data architecture

## Source of truth

The planner uses `data/sword-art-online.sqlite` as its only authoritative data store. Browser `localStorage` is not used after the one-time import. The SQLite file is intentionally ignored by Git because it contains personal data.

`npm run dev` and `npm run start` launch two local processes together:

1. The SQLite API at `http://127.0.0.1:43110`.
2. The Vinext web application at `http://localhost:1998`.

The API accepts requests only from HTTP origins on `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`. It is not intended to be exposed to a network or deployed as written.

## Schema

- `tasks`: one row per task. Frequently queried fields are relational columns; `payload_json` preserves the complete application record for forwards-compatible reads.
- `planner_settings`: the current task-type, location, and default-selection configuration.
- `app_meta`: database initialization, theme, revision, and update timestamp.
- `migration_backups`: immutable JSON snapshots captured during an explicit browser-storage import.

Writes replace the complete planner state inside one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction. A monotonically increasing revision rejects stale writes from another tab. WAL mode and `synchronous = FULL` are enabled for local durability.

## One-time browser migration

On the first database-backed load on a new local origin:

1. The client asks SQLite whether it is initialized.
2. If it is empty, it reads the existing `sao-planner-*` keys from that exact browser origin.
3. It writes the normalized tasks, settings, and theme to SQLite and stores a raw migration backup.
4. Only after the database confirms the transaction does the client remove the old `localStorage` keys.
5. Every later load reads SQLite only, regardless of browser or frontend port.

The historical import in this workspace came from `http://localhost:3001`. After initialization, changing the frontend port does not change application data because every origin reads the same SQLite API. Abandoned browser storage such as `http://localhost:3000` is never read and cannot overwrite SQLite.

## Operations

```sh
# Development: database + hot-reload web app
npm run dev

# Production-like local use
npm run build
npm run start

# Create a consistent SQLite backup while the app is running
npm run db:backup

# Recover historical browser data from the browser profile that created it
npm run recover:legacy -- --port 3001
```

Stop either combined mode with `Ctrl+C`; the launcher shuts down both processes. Backups are written to `backups/` and are ignored by Git.

The recovery command temporarily serves a page on the requested historical port. Open it in the same browser profile that created the tasks. It saves a permission-restricted JSON copy in ignored `recovery/` and never clears the old keys unless the user explicitly presses the clear button.

## Future Dashboard integration

Dashboard code should consume the local API or a future repository/service layer, never reach into browser storage. If remote or multi-device access becomes necessary, preserve this state contract and migrate the storage adapter to D1 or another hosted SQL database. Authentication is required before exposing any state API beyond localhost.
